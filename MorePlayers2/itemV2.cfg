description = "Bless This Many Players!

Play with more than 4 friends and pick duplicate characters!

Works like normal, just select your character in the keep. Currently soft capped at 32 players, but no one has tested that many so far. Let me know how many you manage!

[b]Note:[/b] if you're playing with Pereginaje BTMP must come before it in the mod load order!
